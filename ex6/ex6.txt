1. Docker can reuse previously built layers during image builds. layers are fetched from the cache, reducing the time required to build the image.

2. I think the second option is better because it could cache more commands and save image building time later. 
if we do it all in one command it will cache this long command that we will probably never use again.

3. docker history hello-world(image name)

1. Functions Magic \ Functions Special are functions built in to every class we build, 4 examples:
- __init__ - function that builds an object from our class schema.
- __del__ - destractor function of an object (deletes it).
- __str__ - function that transfroms the object into string value.
- __eq__ - preforms a comparison between two objects of the class.

2. if we dont initiate a __str__ function and we try to print out an object, it will print the name of the class and the place in memory of the object.l
3. if we dont initiate a __eq__ function it will compare the two objects place in memory.

4. Operator overloading is a mathematical symbol that represents a magic method, so when we use the mathematical Operator it will go to the required magic method.
5d. my output is: comparison: False
    print: prints out object place in memory and class name
    + Operator: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'

    We have those issues because we didnt build the needed magic methods
    to fix those issues we need to build magic __str__, __eq__, __add__ methods.

1. kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yaml

2.kubectl patch deployment backend-deployment -n workspace --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/serviceAccountName", "value": "serviceaccount"}]'

  kubectl patch deployment frontend-deployment -n workspace --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/serviceAccountName", "value": "serviceaccount"}]'


3. If we don't configure a service account to our namespace, Kubernetes will create a service account for us named "Default" in our namespace. 
We can fetch the details of that service account "kubectl get pods/<podname> -o yaml".


4. Kubernetes service account let us give an identity to the pods, which could be used for authenticating pods to the Kubernetes api server, allowing the Pods to change Kubernetes objects
   This is needed mostly for deploying applications in a cicd pipeline.
